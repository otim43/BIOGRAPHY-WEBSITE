        <h2>Who is Keith?</h2>
        <p>I live in Seeta-Kigunga, Mukono and my home district is Manafwa. I am a lover of choral music and I do train choirs and sing with them in my free time. I sing with Glorious Queen Choir Seeta and All Saints Catholic Choir Seeta all at St. Augustine Seeta Catholic Parish. </p>
        <h2>What I do</h2>
        <p>I am currently a student at Victoria University doing business computing with hopes of earning a living out of my computer skills when applied in the business world. I do computer repair and maintenance, painting and secretarial services to make ends meet. I currently work with Samanga Solution Ltd. as a free-lance technician and I can offer the services to anyone that needs them as I am just a phone call way. 
I also do music training for choirs in schools, churches and all organizations that need the service at a fee that is negotiable. 
For all those that need my services, you can reach me via email, <a href="malito:keirahwans@gmail.com">send email</a> or direct call on +256 777222008.
</p>
        <h2>Me and My community</h2>
        <p>In the community in which I live, I always spend my evening and free time with my fellow choristers at church teaching them how to sing better. I was also chosen as the leader of all choirs at the parish give my ability to train and teach music.
Lugazi Diocese was selected to lead the Namugongo celebrations next year, 2025 and St. Augustine Seeta Parish being part of Lugazi Diocese, the members of the choirs in which I sing and train were chosen to be part of the choir to animate mass that day. I was also chosen to be part of the music directorsâ€™ team that will prepare the choir for the day. Preparations are already on going and we are hopeful that we shall give our best as a diocese.
